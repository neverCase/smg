/// Being neither load-aware nor cache-aware, it deliberately skips the
/// machinery those policies require: the `WorkerMonitor` never polls it for
/// load (it is excluded from the load-aware set in `policies/registry.rs`), and
/// no KV-event monitor is started for it (gated on cache-aware in
/// `app_context.rs`). For single-backend gateways this also eliminates the
/// `SubscribeKvEvents` subscription overhead.
